                    King Grey has unrivaled strength, wealth, and prestige in a world governed by martial ability.
                    However, solitude lingers closely behind those with great power. Beneath the glamorous exterior of a
                    powerful king lurks the shell of man, devoid of purpose and will.
                    <br>
                    Reincarnated into a new world filled with magic and monsters, the king has a second chance to relive
                    his life. Correcting the mistakes of his past will not be his only challenge, however. Underneath
                    the peace and prosperity of the new world is an undercurrent threatening to destroy everything he
                    has worked for, questioning his role and reason for being born again.
